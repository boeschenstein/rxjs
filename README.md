## switchMap, mergeMap, concatMap, and exhaustMap

-ðŸ¤¯mergeMap: I'm a hard worker, I can prepare multiple orders at the same time ! But I don't respect orders sequence.
  - examples: load data
-ðŸ˜‡concatMap: I respect orders sequence! You will get your order as soon as I finish what I'm currently doing.
  - examples: update data
-ðŸ™„exhaustMap: I'm exhausted ! when I prepare an order, I won't listen to any other order.
  - examples: 
-ðŸ˜ˆswitchMap: I'm mean ! your order will be in trash if I receive new one.
  - examples: filter data
